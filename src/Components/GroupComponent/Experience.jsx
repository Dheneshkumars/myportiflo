                                From February 2025 to September 2025, I worked as a Front-End Developer on the ERP team, focusing on building and maintaining user interfaces using React.js. My responsibilities included developing core modules of the ERP system, integrating front-end components with RESTful APIs, and improving overall performance and responsiveness. I collaborated closely with back-end developers and designers to create efficient and user-friendly dashboards and forms. During this period, I optimized the applicationâ€™s load times, implemented modern React features like hooks and lazy loading, and participated in Agile sprints to ensure timely delivery of new features and enhancements. This role strengthened my skills in React.js, JavaScript, and front-end performance optimization while contributing to a smoother and more responsive ERP user experience.
